      <h2>Privacy Policy for Cyclone</h2>
    </div>
    <section class="terms-section">
      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>TailoredEdTech ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting the privacy of all users of Cyclone (the
        "Service"), our Google Workspace add-on. This includes both the school or institution ("Customer") that
        purchases a license to the Service, and the individuals authorized by the Customer to use the Service ("End
        Users" or "users"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information when the Service
        is used.</p>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
      <p>Cyclone accesses the following information from End Users’ Google Workspace accounts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Email addresses:</strong> Cyclone uses End Users’ Google Account email addresses to associate them
          with their school or institution’s domain name to retrieve the Customer’s product license and schedules.</li>
        <li><strong>Calendar and Calendar Event Details:</strong> Cyclone accesses the calendars and calendar events
          that End Users have access to, including but not limited to calendar names, calendar event titles,
          descriptions, dates and times. We access this data solely for the purpose of scheduling recurring events and
          displaying information to the user as instructed by the Customer and End Users through the Service.</li>
        <li><strong>Open Calendar Events:</strong> When the add-on is open, Cyclone accesses the current event that the
          user has open, including the information displayed above, for the purpose of displaying the scheduling
          interface and scheduling recurring events as instructed by the Customer and End Users through the Service.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>For Customers that explicitly opt-in for Cyclone: Almanac functionality, the following information is sent to an externally-hosted server to generate Google Sheets planners via the Google API:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Email addresses</strong>: Cyclone: Almanac uses End Users’ Google Account email addresses to associate them with a generated Google Sheets document.</li>
            <li><strong>Calendar Event Details</strong>: Cyclone: Almanac accesses calendar events that End Users have opted to include in their planners, including but not limited to calendar event titles, descriptions, locations, dates and times. 
              We access this data solely for the purpose of generating Google Sheets planners for End Users as instructed by the Customer and End Users through the Service.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>We do not share your information with any third parties, except as required by law or legal process.</p>

      <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
      <p>All data accessed by Cyclone is stored and processed within the Google Workspace environment. We rely on
        Google's security measures to protect your data. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method
        of electronic storage is completely secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to
        protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

      <p>For Customers that explicitly opt-in for Cyclone: Almanac functionality, an externally-hosted server is used to generate Google Sheets planners via the Google API.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data Transmission:</strong> Cyclone: Almanac sends the following data to an externally-hosted server using HTTPS, an encrypted protocol using SSL/TLS:
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Email addresses</strong>: Cyclone: Almanac uses End Users’ Google Account email addresses to associate them with a generated Google Sheets document.</li>
            <li><strong>Calendar Event Details</strong>: Cyclone: Almanac accesses calendar events that End Users have opted to include in their planners, including but not limited to calendar event titles, descriptions, locations, dates and times. 
              We access this data solely for the purpose of generating Google Sheets planners for End Users as instructed by the Customer and End Users through the Service.</li>
            </ul>
          <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> No End User data is stored on the externally-hosted server. Planners are created and stored in a Google Drive folder owned by the Customer.</p>
          </ul>

      <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>If the Customer allows End Users under 13 to use the Service, the Customer consents to the collection and use
        of their personal information as described in this Privacy Policy and the Google Workspace for Education Privacy
        Notice, to the extent that COPPA is applicable in the Customer's jurisdiction.</p>

      <h2>6. Customer's Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>The Customer is responsible for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Obtaining any necessary consents from End Users to allow us to access and use their information as described
          in this Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li>Ensuring that End Users understand how their information is used by the Service.</li>
        <li>Complying with all applicable data privacy laws and regulations, including FERPA and COPPA.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Your Choices</h2>
      <p>End Users can control the information Cyclone accesses by modifying the permissions granted to the add-on
        within their Google Workspace settings, although this may impede the functionality of the add-on. They can also
        revoke access to the Service entirely by uninstalling the add-on.</p>

      <h2>8. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any changes on our website or within the
        Service. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date of any changes constitutes your acceptance
        of the revised Privacy Policy.</p>

      <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
      <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a
